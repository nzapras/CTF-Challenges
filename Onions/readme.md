# Challenge 7 - Onions

## Description

The objective of this challenge is to decrypt the provided cyphertext: **R1UyRE1PQldIRTNUR01SUUdZNERNTUpYR01aREFOU0VHWVlUTVJKWEhFWkRBTlNER1lZVE9PSldHVTNURU5aVEdKQ1RFUkpTSVVaREFOQ0RHWTRUTVFSV0dVWkRBTlJSR1pDVEVNQldJWTNFS05SWkdaRERNUkpTSVU9PT09PT0**=

# Solution
**1. Review the Ciphertext**

Reviewing the ciphertext will make users realize that the cipher applied is a simple Ceasarian shift as the ciphertext has no encryption for special chacters used.
 
**2. Decoding the Cyphertext**

The user can then use quick decrpytion tools such as https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher to easily decode the message which transaltes too: **Just like the salad :)**

**3. Entering the Flag**

The user can then simply enter the flag in the following format: flag{Just like the salad :)}
