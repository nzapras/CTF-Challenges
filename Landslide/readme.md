# Challenge 6 - Landslide

## Description

The objective of this challenge is to decrypt the provided cyphertext: **Qbza sprl aol zhshk :)**

# Solution
**1. Review the Ciphertext**

Reviewing the ciphertext will make users realize that the cipher applied is a simple Ceasarian shift as the ciphertext has no encryption for special chacters used.
 
**2. Decoding the Cyphertext**

The user can then use quick decrpytion tools such as https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher to easily decode the message which transaltes too: **Just like the salad :)**

**3. Entering the Flag**

The user can then simply enter the flag in the following format: flag{Just like the salad :)}

# Recreating this challenge 

To recreate this challenge one can follow these steps:

1. Create your plaintext and apply the caeser shift.
2. Create the challenge on the CTF platform with the ciphertext provided in the challenge.
