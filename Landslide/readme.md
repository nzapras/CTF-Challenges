# Challenge 6 - Landslide

## Description

The objective of this challenge is to decrypt the provided cyphertext: **Qbza sprl aol zhshk :)**

# Solution
**1. Review the Ciphertext**

Reviewing the ciphertext will make users realize that the cipher applied is a simple Ceasarian shift as the ciphertext has no encryption for special chacters used.
 
**2. Conduct a Search**

The user can then use quick decrpytion tools such as https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher to easily decode the message which transaltes too: **Just like the salad :)**

**3. Entering the Flag**

The user can then simple enter the flag in the following format: flag{Just like the salad :)}

# Recreating this challenge 

To recreate this challenge one can follow these steps:

1. Create your plaintext and apply the caeser shift.
2. Create the challenge on the CTF platform with the ciphertext provided in the challenge.

This completes the recreation of this CTF Challenge.
