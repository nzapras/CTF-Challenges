## Description

Continuing from Billy Jean I, the goal of this challenge is to fetermine the date the sensitive business data file was created. 

# Solution

The user can the review the file metadata to determine the date the file was created.  This would lead the user to the following the date: `2008-06-12`.  Therefore, the flag is: `flag{2008-06-12}`
